# Final project

This project includes several tasks related to data structures, sorting, recursion, tree traversal, shortest path algorithms, heap visualization, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, and the Monte Carlo method.

## Task List:

**Task 1: Data Structures. Sorting. Working with a Singly Linked List**:

- Write a function that implements the reversal of a singly linked list by changing the links between the nodes.
- Develop a sorting algorithm for a singly linked list, for example, insertion sort or merge sort.
- Write a function that merges two sorted singly linked lists into one sorted list.

**Task 2: Recursion. Creation of the "Pythagoras tree" fractal using recursion**:

- You need to write a Python program that uses recursion to create a Pythagorean tree fractal. The program should visualize the Pythagorean tree fractal, and the user should be able to specify the level of recursion.
